      <p>Data on abuse and violence against journalists worldwide comes from the Committee to Protect Journalists. CPJ provides records on journalist fatalities since 1992. The data used in the graphs below were based on journalists death from the last 10 years (2008 - 2018).

      <p>The first data visualization explores the motive in which each journalist was killed. CPJ tracks the circumstances behind each death by three categories: killed in crossfire/combat; killed on dangerous assignment; and murdered. Journalists killed in relation to their work, but with an unclear motive are labeled as ‘unknown.’ 
<p>

      <p>The first visualization, an interactive bar chart with button navigations, was created entirely in d3.js. It tracks the total number of journalists killed by year, by each confirmed motive and unknown motive. The tooltip provides information on the number of journalists killed each year by each method.<p>

      <h2 class="subhead">Journalists Killed by Nationality (2008 - 2018)</h2>

      <p>The next visualization is an interactive bubble world map also created in d3.js. The map includes data on how many journalists were killed in total from each country. The size of the bubble denotes the number of journalists killed from that country. The tooltip provides information on the number of journalists killed, along with the name of that country.
<p>

      <p>Exploring this data including the motive in which journalists are killed helps analyze the threat against journalists and freedom of speech and media around the world.
